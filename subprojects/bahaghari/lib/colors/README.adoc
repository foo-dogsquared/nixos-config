= Bahaghari library: Colors subset
:toc:

The colors subset of the Bahaghari library.
It's not on the level of https://www.colour-science.org/[Color Science for Python] or https://crates.io/crates/palette[palette library for Rust] where it gives you a complete toolkit for manipulating a lot of aspects of colors.
Rather, this is only in relation to generating them colors to be pressed onto a template like program configurations from Nix modules and even some light templating for some.
Its API should only limit on that aspect.
No way in hell we're trying to reimplment that in Nix, lol.
