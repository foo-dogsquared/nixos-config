= Fair and square

A theme featuring fairly simple graphics with not much bells and whistles.
Thus, it focuses on snapiness and efficient use of keyboard shortcuts.
Intended to be used for potatoes (READ: cheap low-end computers) like mine.

This theme is mainly composed of the following components that are already configured:

- bspwm as the window manager
- polybar for the bars
- rofi for the application laucher and the generic interface
- dunst (and libnotify) for desktop notifications
- feh (for setting the background) with the wallpaper to be used at `./config/wallpaper`.
- Arc is the chosen GTK theme

Here are the miscellaneous programs that are being used.
The theme provides no configuration so you have to make sure the configuration is in the already placed.

- sxhkd (since you're using bspwm, anyways)
