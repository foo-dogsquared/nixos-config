= Development shells
:toc:

My development shells for usual type of projects to quickly spawn one when spelunking other peoples' projects.
This can be easily spawned from the `devShells` attribute from the flake output (i.e., `nix develop $FLAKE#$DEVENV`).
But if you are using a non-flake setup and the channels are set correctly, it should still be usable with `nix-shell <config/shells> -A $SHELL_NAME`.

CAUTION: This is not supposed to be a list of development environment encompassing all type of projects but rather it is just for quickly spawning one for spelunking.

This is a personal preference to creating a specific link:../modules/nixos/profiles/[NixOS]/link:../modules/home-manager/profiles/[home-manager] profile module for setting up those type of environments considering that...

* You don't need a profile to spawn the environment with `devShells`.
By setting it as a profile to either NixOS or home-manager (or any other similar profiles), you're basically locking yourself in that environment.

* It is cleaner. :)

* Creating project-specific development environments is a thing.
