The NixOS configuration is licensed under MIT license since it is also what github:NixOS/nixpkgs[opts=repo] and github:nix-community/home-manager[opts=repo] project is under the same license.
Plus it makes upstreaming certain parts of the configuration (i.e., packages, modules) easier.

The code used to build the website is licensed under MIT license similar to the NixOS configuration.
I just want it to be consistent with the NixOS configuration.
Do whatever you want with it.
