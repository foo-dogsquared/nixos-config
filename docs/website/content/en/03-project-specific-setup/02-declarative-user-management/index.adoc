= Declarative user management

Similarly to xref:../01-declarative-host-management/index.adoc[Declarative host management], this project also provides a way to declare home-manager users.
This is also presented as a custom flake-parts module as well, ready to be configured at `setups.home-manager` namespace of the flake-parts config.

This module is a bit simpler that it only makes configured users to be added to `homeConfigurations` and `deploy.nodes`.

Here's an example user with complete schema.
